Prompt:

Let's build an application that tracks the mood of people. The technologies we will use are NodeJS 18 for the backend and Vue.js 3 for the frontend.
The key features of the app are:
- User management. A login page is required and all data should be scoped by user.
- The app should be able to track the mood of the users over multiple aspects of their life, we will start with the following:
  - health
  - work
  - romantic relationship
  - family relationships
  - friends
  - physical wellness
- Ability to create grafana dashboards based on this data (storing the data in a database that works with grafana & with a data structure allowing a mood dashboard to be created in grafana)

Start with the following:
- Give me instructions on how to bootstrap both backend and frontend projects. I want an http api with an example GET route. I want a landing page that makes a request to the api on that route. I'm expecting all the commands I need to run and all the files I need to create as well as their content.
